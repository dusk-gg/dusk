# Rune Games SDK

Tiny SDK for building multiplayer HTML5 games that run inside Rune for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.rune.tincan) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/rune-games-and-voice-chat/id1450358364).

## Features

- **Social**: Rune has messaging and voice chat so players can hang out together and talk about your game.
- **Fast & Reliable**: Our predict-rollback netcode updates clients immediately and the server resolves any conflicts.
- **Free**: We pay for servers, voice chat, and everything else. It's 100% free to launch your game on Rune.
