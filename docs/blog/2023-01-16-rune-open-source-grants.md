Today we're stoked to announce that we're launching a [$100k grant for open-source web games!](https://github.com/rune/rune-multiplayer-web-games/open-source-grant) ðŸ¥³

Indie game developers and web devs can now receive a grant to make an open-source multiplayer game using JavaScript / TypeScript. With these grants, we hope to support indie devs wanting to make awesome games and dramatically boost the ecosystem!

Rune will award two kinds of grants to indie game devs who make an open-source multiplayer web game:

- **Spark** grants of $500 awarded to promising indie game devs
- **Ignite** grants of $5000 awarded to devs proven themselves with a **Spark** grant

Awardees will also get featured on this blog, in the Rune app and on social media. Check out the [grants page](https://github.com/rune/rune-multiplayer-web-games/open-source-grant) for eligibility, application process, and all the details!

We're so excited to see all the amazing open-source games that you will make!
