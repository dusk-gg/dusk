Have you ever thought about writing a multiplayer game, but the task seems too daunting? What if networking was already done and you could just focus on a small fun game? Dusk makes it easy to build multiplayer games quickly with a huge player base across regional servers.

To celebrate our move to Dusk we're going to run a mini game jam. We've loved what everyone has brought to the table over previous jams and really want more of it!

‚ùì**WHAT:** In this jam you can use any JavaScript based technology, from React to Pixi to Pure JS and everything in between. Here's how it will run:
 * Theme will be announced on the first day of the jam
 * Games should be started and submitted in the jam timeframe.
 * Any art or assets can be used - existing or created for the jam.

üìÜ **WHEN:** The jam will start at **00:01 UTC on August 1st** and run until **23:59 UTC on August 11th**. You'll have 11 days to build and release a multiplayer game on Dusk.

üì© **SUBMITTING:** To submit simply [release the game to Dusk](/docs/quick-start) by the final date and let us know on Discord that its for the jam.

üéñÔ∏è **WINNERS:** Three winners will be selected based on play time of the game in the week starting 18th August. These lucky folks will be receiving a selection of sick Dusk merch.

Remember this is all about creating something from end to end in the time period. Scope carefully and focus on the fun!

As always we can't wait to see what you build and if we're here to help! More information on how to build and publish a game is [available in the documentation](/docs/quick-start). 

Come join us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dusk-devs) to get involved!
