At the core of Dusk, we have games being enjoyed by millions of players. I’m glad to take the time to celebrate one of them, Melancia, that has been doing very well on the platform. This wonderful game was made by [jallen](https://x.com/jallen_dev).

## What’s the Game?

Deceptively simple, the game features a Tetris-style well in which the player drops brightly colored fruits. When two fruits of the same type collide, they combine to make the next bigger fruit. The aim, as the name of the game may give away, is to make melons by combining all the other fruits. Other players are also playing in their own wells, trying to get to the melons before you.

It’s a clean concept implemented with especially satisfying physics and sounds that evidently keep players coming back for more. There’s something very delightful about the pop as you make your next fruit combinations.

## What’s Great About It?

Things that seem to work about Melancia on Dusk (good tips for other devs):

* Simple, understandable mechanics with no text to read
* Bright and obvious graphical style
* Physics—especially shared physics—make for a pleasing experience
* Easy controls for mobile

## How Does It Work on Dusk?

The game was implemented on the Dusk SDK without having to change anything or take any special measures. If you’d like to see for yourself, the source is open:

The game was built over the course of a couple of weeks, which, while short for game development, is pretty common amongst Dusk games. It doesn’t take months of work to put out something to millions of players!
