Hey everyone! 🎉 

The energy around our very first Rune Jam has been so incredibly positive, welcoming and and uplifting, and we’re thrilled to finally announce the winners of this creative extravaganza! 

For 10 whole days, you devs crafted away, the theme of "Creativity," and the results were nothing short of spectacular. Now, let's celebrate the winners who captivated gamers the most:

🥇 First Place: Tonai with [Scribble](https://join.rune.ai/game/5cMS2d6t-MgE) - **14,630 minutes**

* Our top game is writing home with a Rune merch bundle featuring a stylish t-shirt, a cool hat, and a handy water bottle.

🥈 Second Place: PixelPincher with [Chillville](https://join.rune.ai/game/fT2wiMhm-MAE) - **10,372 minutes**

* A fantastic hangout game deserving of a Rune t-shirt and hat.

🥉 Third Place: JumpArtifact with [Triangle Artistry](https://join.rune.ai/game/fChxTUTY-MQE) - **1,730 minutes**

* Rounding out our top three 📐 with a well-earned Rune t-shirt.

We cannot thank everyone enough for making Rune's 1st Jam an unforgettable event. Any game that didn't make the top 3 leader board still will receive some awesome Rune stickers as a token of our appreciate for your efforts and creativity. 

While we celebrate the winning games, we truly believe that the Rune gamers were the real winners here. Every single one of these games were a ton of fun and the playtime hours are definitely a testament to that!
