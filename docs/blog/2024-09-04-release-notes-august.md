## 🛠️ App Improvements

* Unveiled the new home (games 🎮) tab, now featuring game carousels with expandable curation lists like "Puzzle" or "Action" games!
* Revamped our game details page with updated visuals, new play and matching buttons, social proof of how many people love your game, and many more improvements! 🤝
* Added in fun room sounds that pop 💥 so you can easily know when someone leaves, enters, or is reconnecting even without looking at your phone! 
* Shuffled avatar features around in the editor to look better and make more sense 🎨
* 🖼️ Now clicking an avatar anywhere in the app shows the user's profile — quick and easy! 
* Upgraded our main page logic: now it auto-scrolls back to the top when you re-tap the tab’s button on the loaded screen 👆

## 🪲Bug Fixes

* 👥 Updated the friend suggestion logic to recognize when you've added someone as a friend elsewhere in the app.
* Fixed a crash that was happening when auto scrolling to the top on the friends tab if you're already there and have no friends. 
* Busted a small bug where the "friends" label occasionally wasn't showing on friend profiles 🐛
* 🎤Fixed some voice chat start errors by fixing the feedback screen logic! 
* Updated our TikTok social link in the app so everyone can stay up to date on all things Dusk 🔗

## 💻 SDK Improvements

* Built out our behind-the-scenes game tracking to prep for some exciting new developer features coming soon! 🌟     
* Fixed the dev UI mobile layout to account for bottom toolbars on some devices & adjusted the minimum dimensions on landscape 📱
* Added Vue game template built by oats 🚀
* Updated example user avatars to ensure you’re inspired by the newest content!
* Vite plugin now includes logic that allows importing not only external package but also files from external package (somePackage vs somePackage/innerFile). This was done by Pixel Pincher! 🥳
