# Intro

## Why use Rune?

Build a multiplayer game that reaches millions and let Rune handle all the complexity. Here's some things you **don't have to worry about** if you use Rune:

- Netcode
- Hosting servers
- Accounts & friends
- Voice chat
- Matchmaking
- Version mismatches
- Conflict resolution
- Spectating

## Install

Include the following lines in your `index.html` file before loading any other JS scripts:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rune-games-sdk@4/multiplayer.js"></script>
<script src="logic.js"></script>
```

## Game Logic

Create a file named `logic.js` that will be responsible for [syncing game information](syncing-game-state.md) among the players. Write a `setup` function that returns initial values for the `game` state thatâ€™s synced across players. For instance, give all players a score:

```js
function setup(playerIds) {
  const scores = {}
  for (let playerId of playerIds) {
    scores[playerId] = 0
  }
  return { scores }
}
```

Define one or more action functions that modify the `game` state. E.g. here's an action that just increments the score:

```js
function incrementScore(playerIdToIncrement, { game }) {
  game.scores[playerIdToIncrement]++
}
```

Call `Rune.initLogic()` and provide these functions.


```js
Rune.initLogic({
  minPlayers: 1,
  maxPlayers: 4,
  setup,
  actions: {
    incrementScore
  }
})
```

## Rendering

Next, integrate your game UI to [react to game state changes](api/multiplayer.md#runeinitclientoptions) and [send actions to the logic layer](api/multiplayer.md#runeinitclientoptions). This code may live anywhere except in `logic.js`; the docs will refer to `client.js`:

```js
// client.js

// Your game setup code...

// Trigger an action based on user input
button.onClick = () => {
  Rune.actions.incrementScore({
    playerIdToIncrement: "player1",
  })
}

// Initialize the Rune SDK once your game is fully ready
Rune.initClient({
  visualUpdate: ({
    newGame,
    oldGame,
    yourPlayerId,
    players,
    action,
    event,
    rollbacks,
  }) => {
    // Update game based on game state from logic.js
    render(newGame)
  },
})
```
