# Supported Games

Rune handles all the complexity of building a multiplayer game. You don't have to write any netcode or host servers. Moreover, you don't have to worry about game version mismatches, player reconnections, or even having enough players for your game! The [intro section](multiplayer/intro.md) has more details on all the things that Rune handles for you.    

We've made this SDK to make your life simple. We've tried to make it general enough that you can build almost anything. Any game that follows the [overall restrictions](multiplayer/syncing-game-state.md#restrictions) and [logic restrictions](multiplayer/logic-restrictions.md) is supported. Really your imagination is the limit!

## Examples of Supported Games

- Tic Tac Toe, Hex, and other board games
- Chess, Connect Four, Mancala, Battleship, Checkers and other strategy games
- 8 Ball Pool, Golf Around!, Football Tactics & Glory, and other turn-based sports games
- Crosswords, Sudoku, and other co-op games with simultaneous playing
- Catan, Yahtzee, Monopoly and other strategy games with randomness
- Pet Simulator, Powerwash Simulator, The Game of Life, and other simulation games
- Worms World Party, Bowmasters, and other physics-based games 
- Codenames, Guess Who, Werewolf, and other party games

There's a lot more games you can build, these are just some examples to give you an idea of what's possible!

## Adding Support for More Games in Upcoming Version

Rune's multiplayer SDK has some great new updates coming, including fast update loop! This'll add support for classics like Snake and modern real-time IO games.
