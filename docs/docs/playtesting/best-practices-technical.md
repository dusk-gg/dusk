# Best Practices (Tech)

How to code your game to perform the best on Dusk!

### Use Dusk Loading Animation {#use-dusk-loading-animation}

Dusk shows an animation while your game is loading. It's a smoother player experience to only have one progress bar to load your game. Avoid having a loading screen in your game by waiting with calling `Dusk.initClient()` until your game has fully completed loading.

### Send Player Input rather than Player State in Actions {#send-player-input}

We recommend sending player input in actions (e.g. "turning left") rather than player state (e.g. the player's position). This minimizes network data and allows other clients to simulate ahead, thereby making your game work better in bad network settings. Similarly, only send an action when the input changes instead of sending the same player input repeatedly.

### No Ads, Branding and Links {#no-ads-branding-and-links}

One of the amazing things about Dusk is that thereâ€™s no ads. Leave out any ads, branding and links from your game to keep the focus on the gameplay experience ðŸ§˜

### No Network Requests or External Resources {#no-network-requests}

Your game should not use any network requests or external resources. Avoiding these protect player privacy/security and guarantees that your game will keep running even if some external servers get shutdown.

### Gameplay Should not be Affected by Screen Size {#gameplay-should-not-be-affected-by-screen-size}

Your game should ideally scale from small narrow phones with resolutions like 280Ã—653 to wide tablets with resolutions like 1280Ã—800. The gameplay area can be even less on small phones, e.g. only 450 pixels high. Gameplay should not be affected by aspect ratio or resolution. Make sure your game scales to cover the entire screen to provide the best experience.
