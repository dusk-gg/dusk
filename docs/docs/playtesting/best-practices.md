# Best Practices

Here's some advice on making your game a great experience for the players!

### Avoid UI Like Menu Screens, Pause Buttons, Audio Buttons, etc. {#avoid-ui-like-menu-screens-pause-buttons-high-score-screen-etc}

Duskâ€™s UI provides a simple way to play/pause/restart that works for all games so you donâ€™t need a menu screen or a pause button in your game. This lets players get into the action of your game, thereby making it faster to start playing and more fun for players! Similarly, there's no need for any audio buttons as Dusk has in-app UI for that, making things simpler for players.

### Avoid Ads, Branding and Links {#avoid-ads-branding-and-links}

One of the amazing things about Dusk is that thereâ€™s no ads. Leave out any ads, branding and links from your game to keep the focus on the gameplay experience ðŸ§˜

### Avoid Using Cookies, `localStorage` or `IndexedDB` {#avoid-using-cookies-localstorage-or-indexeddb}

Players expect any level information to persist indefinitely, but iOS/Android may reset the cache and clear this information. We're working on a way to make saving data more robust and sync it across devices, but until then please avoid saving data.

### Avoid Loading Bars and Calling `Dusk.initClient()` Prematurely {#avoid-progress-bars-and-calling-duskinitclient-prematurely}

Dusk shows an animation while your game is loading. It's a smoother player experience to only have one progress bar to load your game. Avoid having a loading screen in your game by waiting with calling `Dusk.initClient()` until your game has fully completed loading.

### Send Player Input rather than Player State in Actions {#send-player-input}

We recommend sending player input in actions (e.g. "turning left") rather than player state (e.g. the player's position). This minimizes network data and allows other clients to simulate ahead, thereby making your game work better in bad network settings. Similarly, only send an action when the input changes instead of sending the same player input repeatedly.

### Gameplay Should not be Affected by Screen Size {#gameplay-should-not-be-affected-by-screen-size}

Your game should ideally scale from small narrow phones with resolutions like 280Ã—653 to wide tablets with resolutions like 1280Ã—800. The gameplay area can be even less on small phones, e.g. only 450 pixels high. Gameplay should not be affected by aspect ratio or resolution. Make sure your game scales to cover the entire screen to provide the best experience.

### Gameplay Should Start Easy and Simple {#gameplay-should-start-easy-and-simple}

As a game dev, it's easy to think that your game is very simple to understand. That's because you made it ðŸ˜… Players will need to understand how your game works and what everything means. For that reason, we highly recommend you start your gameplay simple and easy.

### Use Icons Instead of Text {#use-icons-instead-of-text}

Many players speak little to no English so it's ideal if your game can be understood without understanding English.

### Support Two Players {#support-two-players}

The majority of rooms on Dusk have exactly two players. For your game to be most successful, we recommend that it supports playing and is fun when played with one other person.

### Support Spectators {#support-spectators}

Players on Dusk can spectate your game ðŸ‘€ This can happen in many ways, e.g. if someone joins after the room has hit your game's `maxPlayers` or if someone joins after your game has called `Dusk.gameOver()`. You can identify spectators by having `yourPlayerId` as undefined (see [Player Info](../how-it-works/player-info.md)). Spectators should see all gameplay, but not have any UI for performing actions.

### Polish Your Dusk Profile {#polish-your-dusk-profile}

Adjust your name, avatar, and description in Dusk app Profile tab. Your profile will be publicly visible in Dusk app for games that you have created or contributed to.
