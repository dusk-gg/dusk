# Simulating Multiplayer

The Dusk SDK works with common development tools like Vite, Webpack, and Create React App. When you open the URL provided by your build tool, you should see your multiplayer game running inside a mock Dusk app.

To simulate the multiplayer experience during development, Dusk runs many instances of your game side-by-side in the Dev UI. Here you can emulate network latency, game restarts, etc.

## Run on Your Phone {#run-on-your-phone}

You can also test your game on your phone. Just connect to the URL provided by your development tool and you'll see the Dev UI for testing the multiplayer experience. You can also test how your game works on a phone by using Chrome Developer Tools.

The Dusk community will be playing your game in the Dusk app as an actual multiplayer experience. You can playtest your game with friends in the Dusk app while it's still a draft / in review. See [Testing in the Dusk App](./testing-in-app.md) for more info.

## Sharing Playtesting Links {#sharing-playtesting-links}

In case you want other devs to help you playtest your game, you can [upload your game](/docs/publishing/publishing-your-game) to get a playtest link that you can share with them. This link will show the Dev UI so they can simulate multiplayer themselves and try out potential edge cases. The link will work even before the game has been reviewed.
