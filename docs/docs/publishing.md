# Publishing Your Game

It takes only a few minutes to integrate your game with the Rune SDK to get leaderboards, friend challenges, and much more! After integrating, you can test your game using the [`rune` CLI](cli.md).

## Pre-check

### Game Best Practices

Make sure your game follow the [Best Practices](best-practices.md) checklist.

### Logo Requirements

You will need to ensure that the game logo follow these guidelines:

- PNG format
- 600Ã—600 px resolution
- No transparency
- No text

## Upload

Once your game is working and built with best practices, use the [`rune` CLI](cli.md) to upload your game to millions of players. Simply type the follwing in your terminal and follow the instructions:

```bash
rune upload
```

## Sit Back, Relax

The Rune team will now review your game to ensure it follows the best practices and work properly. We'll try to do our best to review your game quickly and it should normally take less than 2-3 weekdays.
