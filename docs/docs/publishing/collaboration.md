# Collaboration

When you create a game, you become an admin. As an admin, you can add other Rune users as team members with different roles: Playtester, Developer or Admin. Use `npx rune-games-cli@latest update-members` in your terminal to set up the team for your game:

- List existing members
- Invite new members using their Rune tag
- Change role of existing member
- Remove existing member

Invited member receive an email invitation that they accept to become a part of the game team.

Each game has its own set of Playtesters / Developers / Admins so you can easily collaborate with different people on each game.

## Roles

All game members can [playtest](/docs/publishing/simulating-multiplayer) game versions in draft / under review in the Rune app. Only Developers and Admins can [publish](/docs/publishing/publishing-your-game) new versions of the game. Note that a game can have multiple Admins.
