# Collaboration

When you create a game, you become an admin. As an admin, you can add other Dusk users as team members with different roles: Playtester, Developer or Admin. Use `npx dusk-cli@latest update-members` in your terminal to update the team for your game:

- List existing members
- Invite new members using their Dusk tag
- Change role of existing member
- Remove existing member

Invited members receive an email invitation that they accept to become a member of the game team.

## Team Roles {#team-roles}

Each game has its own set of Playtesters / Developers / Admins so you can easily collaborate with different people.

All game members can playtest game versions in draft / in review in the Dusk app (see section below). Only Developers and Admins can [publish](/docs/publishing/publishing-your-game) new versions of the game. Note that a game can have multiple Admins.

Developers and Admins are shown in the game's team list in the Dusk app. Playtesters are not shown in the team list.

## Playtesting in Dusk App {#playtesting-in-dusk-app}

As a member of the team who made the game, you can play your game in the Dusk app before it's published to everyone. See [Testing in Dusk App](/docs/playtesting/testing-in-app) for more info.
