# Dev Dashboard

You can open the Dev Dashboard to see how your games are performing, dive into game errors, and see how much you've earned from the [Creator Fund](/docs/publishing/making-money).

## Stats

The dashboard shows you stats for all your games, allowing you to dive into a specific game and specific time period. You can e.g. see how many players played your game, what % of them returned to play the next day and how much time they've spent playing together. There's also more advanced stats like the room sizes, showing you whether your game is mainly being played solo or in groups.

## Game Errors

Rune tracks any errors occurring in your game and shows them on the Dev Dashboard similar to what you might have seen on Google's Crashlytics for Android apps. You can see the most common errors that players are experiencing in your game and track how they change over time.

You can also dive into specific errors and see the stack trace + device info, where the error occurred. In this way, you can quickly identify and fix any issues with your game code.

## OP Level

On the dashboard, you can also see the OP level (short for "overpowered") of your games. The OP level shows how many of the [best practices](/docs/best-practices-gameplay) your game achieves. The idea being that a game that has implemented many of the best practices is more likely to do well on Rune.

The OP level is a simple guide to help you build better games with higher playtime, return rate, etc. The OP level is not used for any algorithms. However, if you follow the OP level guide and increase your metrics, then that'll also make your game more likely to be showcased in the app ðŸ˜„
