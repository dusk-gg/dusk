# Game Logo

All games on Rune have logos. Here's the guidelines for logos:

- PNG format
- 600Ã—868 resolution
- Square w/o rounded edges
- No transparency
- No text

The bottom 130px of the logo is where the text and dev info will be shown. The focal point of the logo should be above this area:

You do not need a logo to upload an initial version for playtesting. It's only needed before releasing the game to the Rune community. We can also make a logo for your game if you'd like, just ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rune-devs)!
