# Game Previews

All games on Dusk have game previews. These help players get a feel for what the game will look like before they play it. Here's the design guidelines:

- PNG format
- 686x960 resolution
- No transparency
- No rounded edges
- No text

The bottom 240 pixels of the game preview is where the text and dev info will be shown. The focal point of the game previews should be above this area.

<img src="/img/publishing/game-preview-example.png" width="400" />

## Update Preview {#update-preview}

If you ever want to update your preview image, then just run `npx dusk-games-cli@latest update-info`.

## Wanna Skip Making One? {#wanna-skip-making-one}

You do not need a game preview to upload an initial version for playtesting. It's only needed before releasing the game to the Dusk community. We can also make a game preview for your game if you'd like, just ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dusk-devs)!
