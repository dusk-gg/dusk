# Making Money

:::caution
The creator fund is not yet launched. It will launch in late September ðŸ¥³ We're sharing these docs already with you now so you can get a sneak peek into what's coming.   
:::

We're passionate about supporting indie game devs in making awesome multiplayer games. As part of that, we have created a creator fund that pays indie devs a bit of money based on their games' metrics. We provide optimized servers and a big audience so you don't need to deal with infrastructure costs or pay for ads.

You can focus entirely on what you do best â€” making great games!

## Payouts based on Metrics

You will earn money based on:
- players who come back the next day to play again
- players who share your game externally
- time players spent actively playing your game

The specific amount of money earned for each of these metrics depends on the player regions (see the next section below). With payouts based on these three metrics, the creator fund supports great games that players love coming back to and want to share with their friends!

## Player Regions

Games often have different localized prices by country and earn different amounts of money per player based on the geo. We incorporate this aspect into the creator fund by scaling the earnings for each metric depending on the playerâ€™s country.

The creator fund has four segments (T1, T2, T3, T4) determined by grouping the per-capita GDP of the worldâ€™s countries. For instance, United States is in T1, Estonia is in T2, Mexico is in T3, and Mozambique is in T4. When launching the creator fund, weâ€™ll share the $ earned for each metric for each segment.

Of course, to make the most money you should translate your games into the most popular non-English languages (Spanish, Russian, Portuguese) so that thereâ€™s more players enjoying your game!

## See Earnings and Withdraw Money

In September, we will release our new game developer dashboard, where you can see stats for all your games. The dashboard also has detailed info on how much each of your games has earned and the calculations behind those earnings.

When you want to cash out your earnings, you submit a request on the dashboard. We review requests within 10 business days and send a payment to your PayPal account.

## Actively Playing

To make the creator fund payouts fair for everyone, we calculate the **active playtime** for all metrics. If someone doesn't interact with a game, then they donâ€™t count as actively playing. More specifically, we donâ€™t count minutes while having the Dusk app minimized or after the player hasnâ€™t interacted with the game for over 5 minutes.

We also want to avoid the creator fund from being gamed by scammers and bots. To combat this, we only count in-app playtime and we use advanced device tracking to prevent banned users from creating new accounts. The latter has been used for multiple years to help ensure the Dusk community is nice and positive. To further combat anyone trying to game the system, we have a per-day 1 minute minimum playtime and 120 minute maximum playtime for each player. I.e. someone leaving their phone open for 24 hours with an auto-clicker will get much lower returns than they hoped for. And of course, we reserve the right to take action against cheating, scamming, etc.

## Itâ€™s Your Game

Dusk is a gaming platform with 10m+ installs and an easy way to build multiplayer games. Weâ€™re not a publisher, i.e. you retain full control over your game and you're free to do what you want with your game regarding its development and distribution.

Itâ€™s also fine if you want to make a Dusk multiplayer version of an existing singleplayer game that youâ€™ve already made. Our community loves all kinds of games!

## Future Plans

Dusk is a young platform and we donâ€™t make revenue yet. While you should not expect to earn a full salary building games on Dusk, we hope that earning a bit of money will help motivate you in your game dev journey. We've heard from many game devs that earning their first $ from their game was magical and that every $ they earn via itch.io and Ko-fi donations feels great. We hope that Dusk can do the same for lots of indie game devs!

As Dusk grows, we will add more ways for you to earn money. For instance, we're planning to build out support for you to add in-game purchases that can be bought with a shared currency across Dusk. When your game starts making revenue using in-game purchases, we will take a small piece of it to cover our platform costs. In this way, we can grow together and build the best possible platform for multiplayer indie games!
