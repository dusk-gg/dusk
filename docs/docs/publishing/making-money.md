# Making Money

The creator fund just launched on Oct 1st ðŸ¥³ To celebrate the launch, all games will earn 3x for Oct-Dec 2024!

We're passionate about supporting indie game devs in making awesome multiplayer games. As part of that, we have created a creator fund that pays indie devs a bit of money based on their games' metrics. We provide optimized servers and a big audience so you don't need to deal with infrastructure costs or pay for ads.

You can focus entirely on what you do best â€” making great games!

## Payouts based on Metrics

You will earn money based on:
- players who come back the next day to play again
- players who share your game externally
- time players spent actively playing your game

The specific amount of money earned for each of these metrics depends on the player regions (see the next section below). With payouts based on these three metrics, the creator fund supports great games that players love coming back to and want to share with their friends!

## Player Regions

Games often have different localized prices by country and earn different amounts of money per player based on the geo. We incorporate this aspect into the creator fund by scaling the earnings for each metric depending on the playerâ€™s country.

The creator fund has four segments (T1, T2, T3, T4) determined by grouping the per-capita GDP of the worldâ€™s countries. For instance, United States is in T1, Estonia is in T2, Mexico is in T3, and Mozambique is in T4.

Of course, to make the most money you should translate your games into the most popular non-English languages (Spanish, Russian, Portuguese) so that thereâ€™s more players enjoying your game!

Here's the earnings for each metric in each region:

## Actively Playing

To make the creator fund payouts fair for everyone, we calculate the **active playtime** for all metrics. If someone doesn't interact with a game, then they donâ€™t count as actively playing. More specifically, we donâ€™t count minutes while having the Rune app minimized or after the player hasnâ€™t interacted with the game for over 5 minutes.

We also want to avoid the creator fund from being gamed by scammers and bots. To combat this, we only count in-app playtime and we use advanced device tracking to prevent banned users from creating new accounts. The latter has been used for multiple years to help ensure the Rune community is nice and positive. To further combat anyone trying to game the system, we have a per-day 1 minute minimum playtime and 120 minute maximum playtime for each player. I.e. someone leaving their phone open for 24 hours with an auto-clicker will get much lower returns than they hoped for. And of course, we reserve the right to take action against cheating, scamming, etc.

## See Stats + Earnings on Dev Dashboard

You can see stats for all your games on the Dev Dashboard. The dashboard has detailed info on how much each of your games has earned each day and the calculations behind those earnings.

The Dev Dashboard is also where you request to enable monetization for your account. You can do that once your games reach 500 hours of playtime within last 30 days. We'll then review if there's any legal issues with your games/account (very unlikely) and enable monetization for you. Your games will start earning immediately after you apply.

## Payout of Accumulated Credits

Your games earn credits each day based on the metrics described earlier on this page. We use this credits system so that in the future you can choose to use some credits for optional extra services like AI-powered gameplay if you like. Credits are automatically converted to dollars for payouts at a rate of $1 = 10000 credits.

At the beginning of each month, we'll email you with a link to claim your earned money for the last month using our payments provider. We aggregate payouts in this way to minimize transaction fees so that each $ goes longer.

## Itâ€™s Your Game

Rune is a gaming platform with 10m+ installs and an easy way to build multiplayer games. Weâ€™re not a publisher, i.e. you retain full control over your game and you're free to do what you want with your game regarding its development and distribution.

Itâ€™s also fine if you want to make a Rune multiplayer version of an existing singleplayer game that youâ€™ve already made. Our community loves all kinds of games!

## Future Plans

Rune is a young platform and we donâ€™t make revenue yet. While you should not expect to earn a full salary building games on Rune, we hope that earning a bit of money will help motivate you in your game dev journey. We've heard from many game devs that earning their first $ from their game was magical and that every $ they earn via itch.io and Ko-fi donations feels great. We hope that Rune can do the same for lots of indie game devs!

As Rune grows, we will add more ways for you to earn money. For instance, we're planning to build out support for you to add in-game purchases that can be bought with a shared currency across Rune. When your game starts making revenue using in-game purchases, we will take a small piece of it to cover our platform costs. In this way, we can grow together and build the best possible platform for multiplayer indie games!
