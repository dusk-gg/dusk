# Publishing Your Game

## Upload

Use the [Rune CLI](publishing/cli.md) to upload your game to millions of players:

```bash
rune upload
```

## Game Logo

All games on Rune have logos. Here's the guidelines for logos:

- PNG format
- 600Ã—600 resolution
- Square w/o rounded edges
- No transparency
- No text

You do not need a logo to upload an initial version for playtesting. It's only needed before releasing the game to the Rune community. We can also make a logo for your game if you'd like, just ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rune-devs)!

## Sit Back, Relax

If you chose that your game is ready for release, the Rune team will review your game to ensure it follows the best practices and work properly. We'll try to do our best to review your game quickly and it should normally take less than 2-3 weekdays.

To have the quickest review experience, make sure your game follow the [Best Practices](publishing/best-practices.md).
