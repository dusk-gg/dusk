# Publishing Your Game

## Upload {#upload}

Use the [Rune CLI](publishing/cli.md) to upload your game to millions of players:

```bash
npx rune-games-cli@latest upload
```

That's it! You can now [playtest](../playtesting/testing-in-app) your game with friends and others in the actual Rune app. To release your game to the larger Rune community, your game will need a [Game Preview](publishing/game-preview.md). We can make one for your game if you'd like.

If you want to upload a new version of your game, just run the upload command again.

## Sit Back, Relax {#sit-back-relax}

If you mark your game as ready for release during upload, the Rune team will review your game to ensure it follows the best practices and works properly. We'll try to do our best to review your game quickly and it should normally take less than 2-3 weekdays. To have the quickest review experience, make sure your game follow the [Best Practices](playtesting/best-practices.md).
