# Supported Games

Rune handles all the complexity of building a multiplayer game. We've made this SDK to make your life simple and we've tried to make it general enough that you can build almost anything. Any game that follows the [overall game guidelines](how-it-works/syncing-game-state.md#restrictions) and [server-side logic](advanced/server-side-logic.md) guidelines is supported.

## Examples of Supported Games {#examples-of-supported-games}

- Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Connect Four, Battleships, and other board games
- 8 Ball Pool, Golf Around!, Football Tactics & Glory, and other turn-based sports games
- Crosswords, Sudoku, and other co-op games with simultaneous playing
- Catan, Yahtzee, Monopoly and other strategy games with randomness
- Pet Simulator, Powerwash Simulator, The Game of Life, and other simulation games
- Worms World Party, Bowmasters, and other physics-based games
- Codenames, Guess Who, Werewolf, and other party games
- SimCity, Age of Empires, Tetris, Plants vs. Zombies and other strategy games
- Snake, Bomberman, Pac-Man, and other fast-paced arcade games

These are just some examples to give you an idea. Pretty much any kind of multiplayer game is possible with the Rune SDK!
