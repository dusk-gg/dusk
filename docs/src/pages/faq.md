### Who Are We?

We’re a small passionate team who love making and playing games together. Rune was founded by Bjarke and Sanjay, who were doing their PhDs together at MIT, but thought it would be more fun to drop out and build something together instead. They decided to start Rune one night at Sanjay’s apartment while playing board games (we were playing Codenames if you’re curious).

### What Is the Benefit of Submitting My Game to Rune?

Rune has 5+ million players so you’ll get tons of people playing your game and giving you feedback. Building a game is fun, but having tons of people actually playing your game makes it 10x more fun. We promote your game for free on our social channels and also provide valuable analytics and use feedback on your game. And don’t forget the bragging rights — Rune shows that you created the game and displays your stats. Next time you meet your friends, you can show them how you built a game with millions of plays.

### Which Game Engines Does Rune Support?

Your game logic must be written in JavaScript/TypeScript, but your rendering code can use any engine that exports to HTML5. This includes all JavaScript-based engines, Unity, Godot, Defold, and many others. If you don’t know how to use Rune with your favorite engine, just ask us!

### Does Rune Host the Games?

Yes, we host the games for free. The games are hosted and cached all over the world to ensure the games load super fast!

### Should My Game Support Both Mobile and Desktop Input?

You don’t have to worry about desktop input. Anyone opening a link to your game on desktop will be directed to play the mobile version.

### How Do You Handle Inappropriate Content?

We want to let you unleash your creativity while still avoiding content inappropriate for the players in the Rune community. As a start, we’re following the Google Play Store Policy, but we’re working on making our own guidelines and age verification. Until then, please make sure that your game adheres to Google’s guidelines on “Inappropriate Content”.
