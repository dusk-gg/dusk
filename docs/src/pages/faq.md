### Who Are We? {#who-are-we}

We’re a small passionate team who love making and playing games together. Dusk was founded by Bjarke and Sanjay, who were doing their PhDs together at MIT, but thought it would be more fun to drop out and build something together instead. They decided to start Dusk one night at Sanjay’s apartment while playing board games (we were playing Codenames if you’re curious).

### What Is the Benefit of Submitting My Game to Dusk? {#what-is-the-benefit-of-submitting-my-game-to-dusk}

Dusk has millions of players so you’ll get tons of people playing your game and giving you feedback. Building a game is fun, but having tons of people actually playing your game makes it 10x more fun. We promote your game for free on our social channels and also provide valuable analytics and use feedback on your game. And don’t forget the bragging rights — Dusk shows that you created the game and displays your stats. Next time you meet your friends, you can show them how you built a game with millions of plays.

### Why did Dusk change name from Rune?

### Why the name Dusk?

Our community of players love to come online in the evening to play with their friends. They jump into a voice room on Dusk, talking and sharing laughs as they explore new games together!

Many of the game devs building Dusk games are hobbyists, who love to to pursue their passion and build their dream game after work/school.

Both sides of our platform come alive in the evening, and the name Dusk captures this perfectly.

### How do I update my game to use the Dusk SDK instead of the Rune SDK? {#how-to-convert-to-dusk}
