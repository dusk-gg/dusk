# eslint-plugin-rune

This package is a collection of rules and configuration for writing safe logic code for the Rune Multiplayer SDK.

## Documentation

- [Logic Restrictions](https://developers.rune.ai/docs/multiplayer/logic-restrictions)

## Contributing

We'd love to get your feedback these rules! Do let us know if you feel like some of our rules are excessively restrictive, or miss unsafe code. You can submit either an issue where you describe the code you want to run and why it's safe/unsafe _OR_ a pull request where we ask for both valid and invalid test cases.
